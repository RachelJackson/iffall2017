<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	<h4>Common wombats are sturdy and built close to the ground. When fully grown, they can reach between 80 and 130 cm, and weigh between 17 and 40 kg. The wombats found on Tasmania and Flinders Island are often smaller than their mainland counterparts. It is distinguished from both hairy-nosed wombats by its bald nose.</h4>

<h3>BEHAVIOR</h3>
	<h4>Common wombats are a solitary,
	territorial species, with each wombat 
	having an established range in which it lives and feeds. In this area, they dig a tunnel system, with tunnels ranging from 2 to 20 m in length, along with many sidetunnels. Often nocturnal, the common wombat does come out during the day in cooler weather, such 
	as in early morning or late afternoon.</h4>
