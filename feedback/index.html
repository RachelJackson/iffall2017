<h1> Postcard Feedback for Madeline Montoya </h1>

<p>
I think your text and image pairings are really funny and work cohesively together. Like James was saying in class, they are pretty pixelated so I think finding higher resolution images would make your postcards more striking. I think there could be a greater hierarchy established between the quotes and their speaker--maybe italicize the name of the character or otherwise differentiate it from the quote itself. The desktop sized images fit pretty well on my laptop screen. The quotes on the desktop images are placed in center/left positions so they're not easily lost when I size down my browser window, however I think that when you're actually coding it, the quotes should be responsive and fit within my browser window no matter what size it is. I also think that choosing a denser font might make the quotes more readable at a small scale--it's not like they aren't right now but it might make more legible and increase their hierarchy within the postcard. Overall I think your postcards are a good set and integrate text and imagery effectively.
