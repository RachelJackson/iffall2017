<br>
	Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me 
<br>
	I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
<br>
	She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
<br>
	In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
<br>
<br>
	<h2> [Pre-Chorus] </h2>
<br>
	Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
<br>
	Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
<br>
	Didn't make sense not to live for fun
<br>
	Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
<br>
	So much to do, so much to see
<br>
	So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
<br>
	You'll never know if you don't go
<br>
	You'll never shine if you don't glow
<br>
<br>
	<h2> [Chorus] </h2>
<br>
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play
<br>
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid
<br>
And all that glitters is gold
<br>
Only shooting stars break the mold
<br>
<br>

<h2> [Verse 2] </h2>
<br>
	It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
<br>
	You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
<br>
	But the meteor men beg to differ
<br>
	Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
<br>
	The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
	<br>
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
<br>
	My world's on fire, how about yours?
<br>
	That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
<br>
<br>

	<h2> [Chorus] </h2>
<br>
	Hey now, you're an All Star get your game on, go play
<br>
	Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid
<br>
	And all that glitters is gold
<br>
	Only shooting stars break the mold
<br>
<br>

	<h2> [Bridge] </h2>
<br>
	(Go for the moon)
<br>
	(Go for the moon)
<br>
	(Go for the moon)
<br>
	(Go for the moon)
<br>
<br>

	<h2> [Chorus] </h2>
<br>
	Hey now, you're an All Star get your game on, go play
<br>
	Hey now, you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid
<br>
	And all that glitters is gold
<br>
	Only shooting stars
<br>
<br>

	<h2> [Verse 3] </h2>
<br>
	Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
<br>
	"I need to get myself away from this place"
<br>
	I said "Yep, what a concept
<br>
	I could use a little fuel myself
<br>
	And we could all use a little change!
<br>
<br>

	<h2> [Pre-Chorus] </h2>
<br>
	Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
<br>
	Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
<br>
	Didn't make sense not to live for fun
<br>
	Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
<br>
	So much to do, so much to see
<br>
	So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
<br>
	You'll never know if you don't go
<br>
	You'll never shine if you don't glow
<br>
